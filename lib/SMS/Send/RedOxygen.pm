=head1 NAME

SMS::Send::RedOxygen - SMS::Send driver for RedOxygen.com RedOxygen

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create a RedOxygen sender. For now, only AccountID+Password authentication
  # is supported; anonymous IP address based sending won't work.
  #
  my $send = SMS::Send->new( 
      'RedOxygen',
      _accountid => 'RedOxygenAccountID',
      _password => 'RedOxygenPassword',
      _email => 'RegisteredEmail'
  );
  
  # Send a message
  $send->send_sms(
      text => 'Hi there',
      to   => '+61 (4) 1234 5678',
  );

  if ( $sent ) {
        print "Sent test message\n";
  } else {
        print "Test message failed\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This SMS::Send driver bridges the SMS::Send API to RedOxygen's web API for SMS
sending. RedOxygen uses custom message formats and response codes and can't just
be used via simple JSON POST calls.

To use this driver you must have a RedOxygen account, either a trial or full account.
RedOxygen's rates are not flat across all regions on most accounts though such accounts
may be negoated.

This driver requires numbers to be in full international format.

LWP::UserAgent must be available for this module to function. This is typically
packaged as libwww-perl on many systems, and can also be installed from CPAN.
