NAME
    SMS::Send::RedSMS - SMS::Send driver for RedSMS.com

SYNOPSIS
      # Create a RedSMS sender. For now, only AccountID+Password authentication
      # is supported; anonymous IP address based sending won't work.
      #
      my $send = SMS::Send->new( 
          'RedSMS',
          _accountid => 'RedSMSAccountID',
          _password => 'RedSMSPassword'
      );
  
      # Send a message
      $send->send_sms(
          text => 'Hi there',
          to   => '+61 (4) 1234 5678',
      );

      if ( $sent ) {
            print "Sent test message\n";
      } else {
            print "Test message failed\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This SMS::Send driver bridges the SMS::Send API to RedOxygen's web API
    for SMS sending. RedOxygen uses custom message formats and response
    codes and can't just be used via simple JSON POST calls.

    To use this driver you must have a RedSMS account, either a trial or
    full account. RedSMS's rates are not flat across all regions on most
    accounts though such accounts may be negoated.

    This driver requires numbers to be in full international format.

    LWP::UserAgent must be available for this module to function. This is
    typically packaged as libwww-perl on many systems, and can also be
    installed from CPAN.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=SMS-Send-RedOxygen>
