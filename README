NAME
    SMS::Send::RedOxygen - SMS::Send driver for RedOxygen.com RedOxygen

SYNOPSIS
      # Create a RedOxygen sender. For now, only AccountID+Password authentication
      # is supported; anonymous IP address based sending won't work.
      #
      my $send = SMS::Send->new( 
          'RedOxygen',
          _accountid => 'RedOxygenAccountID',
          _password => 'RedOxygenPassword',
          _email => 'RegisteredEmail'
      );
  
      # Send a message
      $send->send_sms(
          text => 'Hi there',
          to   => '+61 (4) 1234 5678',
      );

      # An exception is thrown if the web API replies with a HTTP status
      # code other than a 2xx OK or if the reply body error code is anything
      # except 0000. The error can be found in the exception text.

DESCRIPTION
    This SMS::Send driver bridges the SMS::Send API to RedOxygen's web API
    for SMS sending. RedOxygen uses custom message formats and response
    codes and can't just be used via simple JSON POST calls.

    To use this driver you must have a RedOxygen account, either a trial or
    full account. RedOxygen's rates are not flat across all regions on most
    accounts though such accounts may be negoated.

    This driver requires numbers to be in full international format.

    LWP::UserAgent must be available for this module to function. This is
    typically packaged as libwww-perl on many systems, and can also be
    installed from CPAN.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=SMS-Send-RedOxygen>
